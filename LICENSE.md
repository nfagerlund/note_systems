With the caveats that:

- The scripts and code fragments in this repo are so trivial/obvious as to be probably outside of copyright or patent law anyway...
- ...there's nothing original about the design of Garbage Book...
- ...and while I _think_ I was the first person to think of that `^caret-tag` thing, that's also arguably trivial/obvious...
