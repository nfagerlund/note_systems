# Fast Memo Pencil. Fiendish Master Plan. Free Mashed Potatoes.
# It's a three part system. You need:
# 1. A fast way to append lines to a dump file in the FMP dir.
# 2. This script (and a fast way to run it), which moves any lines starting with
#    ^caret-tag to caret-tag.txt. Caret tags can include letters, numbers,
#    underscores (_), and dashes (-).
# 3. A fast way to open a text file in the FMP dir by name.

# Recent changes (Feb 2019):
# - make this script not be stupidly complicated!
# - periods aren't allowed in ^caret tags now. I never used this.
# - no more magic env vars for configuring paths. just edit the scripts.
